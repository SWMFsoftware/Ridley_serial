  ! We have a slight problem with the currents within the MHD code.  When
  ! the IMF By component gets rather large, the current flowing into each
  ! hemisphere does not balance. If the Earth did not exist, the MHD code
  ! would work quite well; in that the total current flowing into and out
  ! of the ionosphere over the whole Earth balances exactly.  Because we
  ! put an inner boundary on the problem and do not let the current flow
  ! between the hemispheres, we have a problem.  This is true for the real
  ! Earth also - very little current flows between the hemispheres.
  !
  ! We have devised a way to force the current flowing in and out to be
  ! approximately equal.  Namely, we add up the current flowing in and
  ! out, determine which one needs a little more and by how much, then we
  ! multiply the current which needs more by a factor, allowing it to raise
  ! to approximately the same value as the other current.
  !
  ! This is physically unjustified.

     ! The MHD code does not do well with Region 2 currents. These currents
     ! are created by pressure gradients in the inner magnetosphere which may
     ! be overwhelmed by other features of the code, such as the inner
     ! boundary condition on pressure and density.  If that is the case, then
     ! we may need to create fake region 2 currents.  These currents are
     ! basically just equatorward of the region 1 currents and have the
     ! opposite sense - namely up on the dawn side and down on the dusk side.
     ! We approximate these by a sin function.
